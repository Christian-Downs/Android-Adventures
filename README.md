# Android-Adventures
This is a repository with all my work while I worked through <a href = "https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/course">Android Basics with Compose</a>.

Order of work:
<ol>
<li> <a href = "https://github.com/Christian-Downs/Android-Adventures/tree/master/Birthday%20Greeting%20Card">Birthday Greeting Card</a>: This goes into basic text and image editing. </li>
<li>  <a href = "https://github.com/Christian-Downs/Android-Adventures/tree/master/ComposeQuadrantTraining">ComposeQuadrantTraining</a>: This was self guided practice in app layout using rows, columns and modifiers. </li> 
</ol>
